# AlchemistBoardGameHelper
A python console application for bookkeeping of the [Alchemist board game](https://czechgames.com/en/alchemists/).

## Features
  - Fast text input to record results of making potions
  - Keeps tracks of made potions
  - Clearly shows all the known facts about each ingredient
  - Provides probability matrix for easy decision making
  - Saves paper!

## Possible TODOs
  - Update for [expansion](https://czechgames.com/en/alchemists-kings-golem/)
  - Provide commands for artifacts which reveal additional informations about other players
  - Use information theory to hint at ingridents combinations providing the most information gain
  - Provides commands for recording other peoples moves to influence probabilities
  - Provide commands to assume a combination and recalculate the state
     - Alerting when disproved would be nice
  - Probability calculation literally brute-forces all combinations, figuring out the math would be nice optimization
